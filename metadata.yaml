description: "The Expedition of Humphry Clinker was the last of the picaresque novels\
  \ of Tobias Smollett, published in London on 17 June 1771 (just three months before\
  \ Smollett's death), and is considered by many to be his best and funniest work.\
  \ It is an epistolary novel, presented in the form of letters written by six characters:\
  \ Matthew Bramble, a Welsh Squire; his sister Tabitha; their niece Lydia and nephew\
  \ Jeremy Melford; Tabitha's maid Winifred Jenkins; and Lydia's suitor Wilson.\n\
  Much of the comedy arises from differences in the descriptions of the same events\
  \ by the participants. Attributions of motives and descriptions of behaviour show\
  \ wild variation and reveal much about the character of the teller. The setting,\
  \ amidst the high-society spa towns and seaside resorts of the 18th century, provides\
  \ his characters with many opportunities for satirical observations on English life\
  \ and manners.\nThe author's travels in Scotland, France, and Italy helped provide\
  \ inspiration for the plot.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
